Description: Provides the infrastructure necessary to create a personal, 
    team-building quiz you can play with your colleagues online with video 
    conferencing, Google Sheets and a web browser. Contestants provide questions
    and answers about themselves, without giving away the answer. During the 
    quiz they answer their own questions and thus reveal which answer is 
    correct. It's a fun way to get to know more about the people you work with.
